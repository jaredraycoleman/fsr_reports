Prof. Coleman did a great job organizing the course. He was also great at explaining everything and I really enjoyed how he published the lecture notes and spent class going through examples on the board. I also really liked how the classworks were mostly on paper, as it helped me understand the theory more which actually also made the programming parts during homework easier. I also really liked the TA Recitation as it was a nice refresher and helped me understand things that I didn't during class.","The only thing would be having zoom recordings for the lectures which would have been helpful for the times I was unable to make it,  but I understand the reasoining behind not having it."

For a class like CMSI 2130, approaches always vary depending on the situation, the expected outcome to achieve, and the constraints. By working extensively on a set number of scenarios for every topic we covered, Professor Coleman prepared us to extrapolate from those example problems and apply that understanding not only to similar types of problems on exams but also to completely new scenarios we might encounter in the real world. I also appreciated Professor Coleman's willingness to help us understand and his supportive attitude, especially given that some of the topics we covered were fairly complex. He was a very likable professor who genuinely cared about our learning experience.","Given that this might be Professor Coleman's first few semesters of teaching, I noticed he relied heavily on Professor Forney's website, slides, and course content (who I believe was on sabbatical during this time). This occasionally caused hiccups during lectures, where Professor Coleman would either need time to understand problems he had taken from the website or would backtrack on previous explanations. While Professor Forney has clearly taught this course for quite some time and developed extensive materials with in-depth content and resources, I wish Professor Coleman would develop his own class structure and assignments (if he plans to teach this course long-term). I believe professors are much more effective when teaching with problems and topics they've personally developed and thoroughly understand. There were multiple instances where Professor Coleman needed time to interpret the problems himself before explaining them to us. This highlighted a disconnect in the teaching process—despite his clear expertise in the field, his ability to effectively communicate that knowledge to students sometimes fell short. Despite his willingness to support us and offer office hours whenever needed, many students realized they could learn more efficiently at home using Professor Forney's website with its comprehensive explanations—and could work at their own pace—rather than attending the 8 AM lectures with Professor Coleman. However, if Professor Coleman was simply a temporary replacement for Professor Forney, then his teaching approach was sufficient, and I appreciate his efforts to support us throughout the course."

I also thought the class and everything was really organized and easy to follow. I liked how there were bonus classwork assignments that gave extra practice for the exams and it gave us the opportunity to make up  any points lost in previous classwork assignments. I thought it was really well taught and was very engaging, especially considering it was a 8am class. I thought the exams were really fair and were a good representation of what we learned. In previous computer classes, I felt like there were topics on the exams that weren't  covered enough in class for me to properly understand and answer them. For these exams, I felt  had seen everything that was being asked and was gettable for anyone who studied for the emac.","I think this class is pretty effective as it is because I was able to follow along and understand the lessons and the assignments. There wasn't really anything I thought was missing or something extra that could have made it more effective."
