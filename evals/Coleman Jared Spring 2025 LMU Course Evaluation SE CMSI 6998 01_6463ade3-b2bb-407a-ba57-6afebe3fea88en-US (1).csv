It not only improved my ability to assess academic work but also helped me articulate insights more clearly in group discussions. This focus on paper analysis was a key highlight for me.","Overall, I’m mostly satisfied with the course. Adding more students could have created more discussion opportunities and diverse perspectives during paper reviews."

However, learning how to read through a paper effectively and how to branch out from it to related topics has been a valuable lesson in itself. I’m truly grateful to the professor for that.","Reading a wide range of papers and working on the final project were especially helpful for me. Although I still have a lot to learn, I believe this course provided meaningful direction for the rest of my master’s journey."
