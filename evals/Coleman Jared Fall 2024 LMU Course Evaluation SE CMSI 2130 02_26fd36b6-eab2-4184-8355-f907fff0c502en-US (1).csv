Although assignments were typically assigned one to two weeks in advance, the programming tasks were often very challenging. Balancing these assignments with other classes and unexpected responsibilities made it difficult to complete them on time without encountering issues.

In my case, scheduling conflicts prevented me from attending office hours consistently, further limiting my time to work on assignments. Despite explaining these challenges or unexpected circumstances, the professor maintained a strict no-extension policy. However, sometimes all that was needed to successfully complete the work was an extra day or even just a few additional hours.

While I understand that adhering to deadlines is important, giving students some flexibility might really allow them to learn more and complete assignments without stressing over due dates. This way, they will be able to thoroughly grasp the material rather than rush through, thereby misunderstanding or incorrectly applying key concepts."
